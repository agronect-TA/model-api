    'Corn Healthy': {
        'description': 'Corn plants are vigorous with bright green, erect leaves, a strong root system, and full, evenly developed ears of corn.',
        'solution': 'Ensure proper nutrition through balanced fertilization, adequate spacing to reduce competition, timely irrigation, and regular monitoring for any signs of pests or diseases.'
    },
    'Corn Gray Leaf Spot': {
        'description': 'Gray Leaf Spot is a fungal disease caused by Cercospora zeae-maydis. It manifests as small, rectangular, gray to tan spots on leaves, which can coalesce into larger areas of necrosis, reducing photosynthetic capacity and potentially decreasing yield significantly.',
        'solution': 'Managing Gray Leaf Spot involves rotating with non-host crops, using resistant corn varieties, and applying fungicides when necessary. Good field hygiene, such as removing crop residues, is also effective in reducing the fungal inoculum.'
    },
    'Corn Common Rust': {
        'description': 'Common Rust in corn is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. It appears as raised, brick-red pustules on both surfaces of the leaves. These pustules break open, releasing spores that spread to other plants. While not usually devastating, severe infections can reduce photosynthesis and impair growth.',
        'solution': 'To control Common Rust, use resistant varieties if available, apply fungicides during early stages of disease development, and avoid planting too densely to reduce humidity levels among the plants.'
    },
    'Corn Northern Leaf Blight': {
        'description': 'Northern Leaf Blight, caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum, produces large, cigar-shaped gray to tan lesions on the leaves. This disease can lead to significant leaf damage, affecting photosynthesis and potentially reducing the crop yield.',
        'solution': 'Managing Northern Leaf Blight includes planting resistant corn varieties, rotating crops to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil, and applying fungicides if the disease pressure is high. Maintaining proper spacing and field sanitation can also help minimize the impact of this disease.'
