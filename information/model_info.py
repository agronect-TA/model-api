        "diseases":{
            'Brown Spot': {
        'description': 'Brown spot is a fungal disease caused by Bipolaris oryzae. It is characterized by small, circular, brown to reddish-brown spots on the leaves, which can coalesce to form larger lesions. The spots may have a yellowish halo and can cause the leaves to become yellow and wither. In severe cases, the disease can cause significant yield loss.',
        'solution': 'To manage brown spot, use resistant varieties, which can better tolerate the pathogens and reduce damage. Implement cultural controls such as adjusting nitrogen fertilizer application, maintaining good water management, and controlling weeds. Apply fungicides as recommended, and consider using organic amendments like neem cake or mustard cake to suppress the disease.'
    },
    'Healthy': {
        'description': 'Rice plant is one that is free from diseases and pests, with green leaves and stems, and produces grains that are plump, filled, and free from defects.',
        'solution': 'To maintain healthy rice plants, use good agricultural practices such as providing adequate water and nutrients, controlling weeds, and rotating crops. Choose disease-resistant varieties and implement integrated pest management strategies to prevent diseases and pests from affecting your crop.'
    },
    'Leaf Blast': {
        'description': 'Leaf blast is a fungal disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. It is characterized by small, diamond-shaped, grayish-white to white lesions on the leaves, which can cause the leaves to become yellow and wither. The disease can also cause neck blast, which affects the panicle, leading to significant yield loss.',
        'solution': 'To manage leaf blast, use resistant varieties, which can better tolerate the pathogens and reduce damage. Implement cultural controls such as adjusting nitrogen fertilizer application, maintaining good water management, and controlling weeds. Apply fungicides as recommended, and consider using organic amendments like neem cake or mustard cake to suppress the disease. Remove infected leaves or plants to prevent the spread of the disease.'
    },
    'Neck Blast': {
        'description': 'Neck blast is a fungal disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. It is characterized by the formation of lesions on the neck of the panicle, which can cause the panicle to become rotten and the grains to become discolored. The disease can lead to significant yield loss and reduce grain quality.',
        'solution': 'To manage neck blast, use resistant varieties, which can better tolerate the pathogens and reduce damage. Implement cultural controls such as adjusting nitrogen fertilizer application, maintaining good water management, and controlling weeds. Apply fungicides as recommended, and consider using organic amendments like neem cake or mustard cake to suppress the disease. Remove infected panicles or plants to prevent the spread of the disease. Implement good harvesting and drying practices to reduce the risk of neck blast.'

    'Cassava Bacterial Blight': {
        'description': 'Cassava bacterial blight is a bacterial disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis. It is characterized by the formation of water-soaked lesions on the leaves, which can become necrotic and cause the leaves to become yellow and wither. The disease can also cause stem cankers and reduce yield.',
        'solution': 'To manage cassava bacterial blight, use resistant varieties, which can better tolerate the pathogens and reduce damage. Implement cultural controls such as adjusting planting dates, increasing plant spacing, and removing infected leaves or plants to prevent the spread of the disease. Use good sanitation practices, such as cleaning tools and equipment, to prevent the spread of the disease. Apply copper-based bactericides as recommended.'
    },
    'Cassava Brown Streak Disease': {
        'description': 'Cassava brown streak disease is a viral disease caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). It is characterized by the formation of brown, necrotic lesions on the leaves, stems, and tubers. The disease can cause significant yield loss and reduce tuber quality.',
        'solution': 'To manage cassava brown streak disease, use resistant varieties, which can better tolerate the pathogens and reduce damage. Implement cultural controls such as adjusting planting dates, increasing plant spacing, and removing infected plants to prevent the spread of the disease. Use good sanitation practices, such as cleaning tools and equipment, to prevent the spread of the disease. Control whiteflies, which are the vectors of the disease, using insecticides as recommended.'
